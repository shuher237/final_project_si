### **Which case is being solved**
   Developed machine learning application using OpenAI and Telegram API and deployed on Streamlit Cloud.

### **Task conditions**
   1. The project source codes must be in the GitHub repository.
   2. The GitHub repository has CI processes configured.
   3. CI processes must include:
   4. Executing unit tests.
   5. Checking code style for PEP8 compliance.
   6. Development of application features should be carried out in separate branches.
   7. When merging a branch into the main repository, a Code Review must be performed.
   8. Application code must follow PEP8 style and clean code rules.
   9. The project can use a pre-trained model. There is no need to train your own model.
   10. You need to configure application deployment to the cloud platform. Recommended cloud platforms:
         **Streamlit Cloud (for applications on Streamlit)**
         Yandex.Cloud
         Hugging Face Spaces
   11. You need to submit documentation for the developed application in the GitHub repository

### **Quality metrics**  
   To check the operation of the chatbot, testing was used using the pytest library, the flake8 linter was also configured and automatic code formatting was applied using the black library.

### **What is being practiced**
   In this project, the skills of using Git and Github are practiced in a team development environment, deploying a project on a cloud platform, performing unit tests, as well as checking the quality and style of code.
