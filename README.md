### **Task conditions**
   1. The project source codes must be in the GitHub repository.
   2. The GitHub repository has CI processes configured.
   3. CI processes must include:
   4. Executing unit tests.
   5. Checking code style for PEP8 compliance.
   6. Development of application features should be carried out in separate branches.
   7. When merging a branch into the main repository, a Code Review must be performed.
   8. Application code must follow PEP8 style and clean code rules.
   9. The project can use a pre-trained model. There is no need to train your own model.
   10. You need to configure application deployment to the cloud platform. Recommended cloud platforms:
         **Streamlit Cloud (for applications on Streamlit)**
         Yandex.Cloud
         Hugging Face Spaces
   11. You need to submit documentation for the developed application in the GitHub repository
